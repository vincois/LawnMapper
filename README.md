Working on a way to map an area with X,Y,Z coordinates. 

SC Data points
======

The intent is to use /showlocation to place the players current position into the OS's clipboard. 

Using those X,Y,Z coordinates to plot a dot in 3d space. Then between each dot, draw a line to represent a wall/path. 

I have the coordinates placed into variables in two ways.
